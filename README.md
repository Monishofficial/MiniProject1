## **Title of the Project**
**EXAM TIMETABLE AND SEATING ARRANGEMENT SYSTEM**

---

## **Small Description**
Educational institutions face challenges in manually preparing exam timetables and seating arrangements due to time consumption, errors, and scheduling conflicts.
Managing large numbers of students with limited classroom resources makes manual planning inefficient and error-prone.
An automated system is needed to generate accurate timetables and seating plans, reducing effort and improving reliability.

## **About**
 **Exam Timetable and Seating Arrangement System**
The purpose of this project is to automate the process of generating exam timetables and seating arrangements efficiently.


It aims to eliminate scheduling conflicts by ensuring that no student has overlapping exams.


The system seeks to reduce the workload of administrative staff by replacing manual planning with an intelligent automated solution.


It ensures fair seating allocation to minimize malpractice by separating students from the same department or subject.


The project improves transparency and accuracy in exam management while saving time and resources for educational institutions.
